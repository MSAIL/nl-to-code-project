# MSAIL Natural Language to Code Project

This is a brief guide for the NL to Code project in MSAIL 2020-2021.

## Getting Started
Here are a few resources for getting started with this project:

* [Text2SQL Introduction Series](https://medium.com/visionwizard/text2sql-part-1-introduction-1327cf7f5f51) - This is set of Medium posts that give a good introduction to the problem and approaches to turning natural language into SQL
* [A Visual Guide to Using BERT for the First Time](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/) - A blog post introducing how to use BERT, the language model developed by Google
* [BERT Github Repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
* [BERT with Cloud TPU Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/tools/colab/bert_finetuning_with_cloud_tpus.ipynb) - A Colab notebook to fine-tune and play around with BERT
